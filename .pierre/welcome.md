Hey Peak,

Welcome to Pierre! AND congratulations on pushing your first change!

We do our best to summarize and categorize all the work you do (as seen above ^).

And the more you push, the more Pierre learns what type of engineer you are and what types of changes you actually care about.

To get started, click around a bunch… and maybe even highlight this **WORD** to leave a comment or suggest a change??

Or invite some friends, review some code, wire up some CI jobs, etc…

If you have questions or feedback at all, head over to our Discord community. We’d love to hear from you! [https://discord.gg/QJtTu5hpzx](https://discord.gg/QJtTu5hpzx)
